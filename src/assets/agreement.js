Account Agreement
Last updated: July 20, 2022; Effective: July 20, 2022

IMPORTANT – Please read carefully and retain this Account Agreement for your records.

This Account Agreement (the “Agreement”) contains the rules that govern, where appropriate, the contractual relationship account(s) and card(s) between You World Inc., including its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, and assigns, (“YouWorld,” “Wildcard,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and you (“you” and “your”) when you use service and features through our website or web portal (the “Services”). Using the YouWorld Services means that you have accepted all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and the Privacy Policy. You should read all of these terms carefully before creating a WildCardr Account or using our Services. 

Your account(s) is issued and operated by YouWorld. If you have any questions about this agreement, please contact us at hello@bewildcard.com    The funds in your account(s) with YouWorld are administered and held by First Pryority Bank (“Bank”), who is also the issuer of your WildCard card. First Pryority Bank is an FDIC insured, equal opportunity lender. You may view their privacy policy at any time.

1. Definitions

The words “you” and “your” mean each account owner and anyone else with authority to deposit, withdraw, or exercise control over an account. If there is more than one owner, then these words mean each account owner separately, and all account owners jointly. 

An “owner” is one who has the power to deal with an account in his, her or its own name. 

An “agent,” in contrast, is one whose power to withdraw from an account comes from, or is on behalf of, the owners. Authorized signers, attorneys-in-fact, and convenience signers are examples of agents. 

“Personal accounts” are accounts in the names of natural persons (individuals). They are to be distinguished from “non-personal accounts” which are accounts in the name of corporations, partnerships, trusts and other entities. 

“Deposit Account” means any checking account opened with YouWorld. 

“Card” means the YouWorld Visa debit card which is issued by First Pryority Bank in the name of the Cardholder for carrying out of all Card Transactions from an account held with YouWorld, as provided for in these Account Agreement Terms and Conditions.

“Cardholder” means the person in whose name an Account has been opened and in whose name a Card is issued

“Card Transactions” means any payment made for goods or services, cash withdrawals from a bank or financial institution (including ATM withdrawals) or transfer of funds made through the use of the Card or the Card number

“Financial Service” means a Deposit Account, overdraft credit account, Bill Payment service, Funds Transfer service, or any other financial product or service available through YouWorld. 

Unless it would be inconsistent to do so, words and phrases used in this Agreement should be construed so that the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular. 

2. Consent to Terms and Conditions and Modifications

By enrolling in services or applying for an account with YouWorld, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the account and any fees that may be imposed. The terms and conditions of your account include this Agreement, any disclosures we give you when you open your account, subsequent disclosures we provide when using additional products and services, periodic statements, user guides, our Privacy Policy, and any other disclosure or terms we provide to you. 

We may unilaterally decide to amend or change from time to time any terms of this Agreement or any account disclosures and documents provided to you. Notice of the amendment or change will be provided to you as required under applicable law. However, such changes will not impose additional obligations on you concerning actions you had taken before the change became effective unless you specifically agree to such changes. Continued use of your account means you agree to these terms and any changes, you agree to pay the fees listed, and you give us the right to collect the fees, as earned, directly from your account balance or any linked external accounts. If at any time the terms, conditions, or fees associated with your account are not acceptable to you, you may terminate this Agreement by closing your account after paying any fees or charges owed to us. We may cancel or suspend your account, debit card, or other account services or this Agreement at any time.

3. Business Days

For purposes of these disclosures, our business days are Monday through Friday, unless stated otherwise. Federal holidays are not included.

4. Waivers and Precedents

Any waiver by YouWorld must be approved by an authorized representative of YouWorld or First Pryority Bank. If a waiver is approved by us, we are not obligated to provide similar waivers in the future.

5. Identification Notice (USA PATRIOT ACT)

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.

This means that when you open an account or use our services, we may ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see other identifying documents such as driver's license, passport, or other documents that validate your identity.

Even if you have been an existing customer of ours, we may ask you to provide this kind of information and documentation because we may not have collected it from you in the past or we may need to update our records. 

If, for any reason, any owner is unable to provide the information necessary to verify their identity, your account(s) may be blocked or closed, which may result in additional fees assessed to the account(s).

You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied to us in connection with your account and/or account services and for keeping your personal data with us updated if you move or otherwise make changes to your personal data.

6. Who Can Use the Service

Only individuals 18 or older who have full legal capacity to form a legally binding contract can use our Services. Only individuals who accurately provide his/her true and correct personal details can use our Services. We may impose other restrictions as well.

When you sign up for an Account with us, you will be prompted to agree to First Pryority Bank’s Privacy Notice. You authorize us to share any of your information with First Pryority Bank for the purposes of establishing and administering your Account. It is your responsibility to make sure the data you provide us is accurate and complete.

YouWorld will provide you with any and all notifications as well as all customer support related to your Account. Please contact us if you have any questions at hello@bewildcard.com.

10. Connected Accounts

To ensure a more valuable experience with YouWorld, YouWorld uses Plaid Financial Ltd (“Plaid”) to gather End User’s data from external financial institutions you connect via the YouWorld App. By using our service, you grant YouWorld and Plaid the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution. You agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored, and processed by Plaid in accordance with Plaid’s Privacy Policy at plaid.com/legal.

11. Account Balances

You agree to maintain a positive balance at all times and will not incur overdrafts. If you manage your account in such a way that it results in a negative balance or becomes overdrawn, you agree to rectify the matter by transferring sufficient funds from your linked external account to pay the overdrawn balance. Your failure to bring your account to a positive balance could result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account and services. Further consequences may be enacted if you do not remedy the situation in a timely manner and may include: (1) the reporting of your negative balance to a reporting agency; (2) legal action; and/or (3) charging you fees for the overdraft in accordance with our Schedule of Fees.

12. Account Closing

If you wish to close your account with us, you agree to withdraw all funds from your account.  We may also require you to notify us of this intention in writing. After an Account is closed, we have no obligation to accept deposits or pay outstanding items but may do so at our discretion. You agree to hold us harmless for refusing to honor any item on a closed account. If funds remain in the account after you have notified us of your intent to close your account, we will require you to submit your request to us in writing and we will return any remaining funds to your linked external account.  All related closing fees will be deducted from the final balance.

13. Foreign Activity

If you have moved outside of the United States or have frequent international transactions, you may be contacted about the international activity in your account and for further verification of your address. If you are moving, traveling, or will be temporarily residing overseas, we recommend you contact us to prevent any disruption in your account activity. Your account may be closed.

14. Inactive and Dormant Accounts

We may consider a Deposit Account to be “inactive” after a period of no owner-initiated activity. After a period of “inactive” status, we may consider a Deposit Account to be “dormant”, at which time it will be closed.

If the account becomes inactive or dormant, the account will continue to be subject to any service charges in accordance with our schedule of fees. If an account becomes inactive, we will notify you with specific instructions on how to restore the account to an active status without the need to make any transactions.

15. Death or Incompetence

You or your appointed party, designee, or appointed individual agree to notify us promptly if any agent or person with signatory rights on your account dies or becomes legally incompetent or incapacitated. We may continue to honor any items submitted until (a) we know of the fact of death or of a legal determination of incompetence or incapacitation and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that knowledge. You agree that, even if we have knowledge of death of an agent or person with signatory rights, we may pay items drawn on or before the date of death for up to 10 days after that date, unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming an interest in the account. We may require additional documentation to confirm any claims made on the account.

16. Levies, Garnishments, and Other Legal Processes

If your account becomes subject to legal action, such as a tax levy or third-party garnishment, we reserve the right to refuse to pay any money from your account, including checks or other items presented for payment, until the action is resolved. If we are required to pay an attachment, garnishment or tax levy, we are not liable to you. Payment is made after satisfying any fees, charges or other debts owed to us. You agree that you are responsible for any expenses, including legal expenses and fees we incur due to a garnishment, levy or attachment on your account. We may charge these expenses to your account. Until we receive the appropriate court documents, we may continue to process transactions against your account, even if we have received an unofficial notification of an adverse claim. You will indemnify us for any losses if we do this.

17. Confidentiality

We will disclose information about your account or the transactions you make to third parties:

When it is necessary to complete transactions;
To verify the existence and standing of your account with us upon the request of a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant;
In accordance with your written permission;
In order to comply with court, governmental, or administrative agency summonses, subpoenas or orders; and
On receipt of certification from a federal agency or department that a request for information is in compliance with the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978.

By providing your mobile phone number to us, you provide your prior express consent for us and our service providers to send YouWorld OTP texts to your number using an autodialer.

18. Withdrawals from Accounts

Unless otherwise indicated by us, anyone who is listed as an account owner, or is assigned Power of Attorney privileges may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the account balance at any time on forms approved by us or with your debit card, through Bill Pay, or other available services.

We reserve the right to refuse any withdrawal or transfer request that is attempted by any method not specifically permitted or that exceeds any frequency or monetary limitations. Even if we honor a nonconforming request or allow a transaction or transaction(s) to overdraw your account, repeated abuse of the stated limitations, or regularly overdrawing your account, may force us to close the account. We will use the date a transaction is completed by us (as opposed to the day you initiated it) to apply the frequency limitations.

19. Deposits to Accounts

All items deposited will be handled by us as agent for you. All checks submitted for deposit must be made payable to you. We do not accept cash. We do not accept third-party checks. We do not accept deposits in foreign funds or checks drawn on Bank’s outside the United States. We reserve the right to reject a deposit if it is made payable to YouWorld or First Pryority Bank and contains no other information that might assist us in identifying the account to which it should be deposited. We reserve the right to refuse any other type of deposit if we believe it is fraudulent, will not be paid, it is not made payable to you, or is otherwise suspicious in nature. We will not be held liable if such action causes outstanding items to be dishonored and returned, or payment orders to be rejected. Refused deposits will be returned to the depositor.

19.1 Automated Clearing House Deposits

In order to transfer funds from an account that you own or have control of at another financial institution to your account at YouWorld using the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Funds Transfer service, we use a service called Plaid Financial Ltd (“Plaid”) to gather your data from external financial institutions you connect via the YouWorld App. By using our service, you grant YouWorld and Plaid the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution. You agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored, and processed by Plaid in accordance with Plaid’s Privacy Policy at plaid.com/legal. ACH transactions will not be processed and accessible until the service is activated by us. Funds from these types of deposits will not be available until after the funds have settled.

19.2 Deposited Items Returned

If final payment is not received on any item you deposited to your account, or if any direct deposit, ACH deposit or Electronic Fund Transfer to your account is returned to us for any reason, you agree to pay us the amount of the return.

We may charge any account of which you are an owner or re-present any item you deposit with us that is returned to us unpaid without prior notice to you. We may charge a fee for returned deposited items in accordance with our Schedule of Fees.

You authorize us to attempt collection of previously returned items that you deposited. In our attempts to collect these items, you agree that we may allow the payor bank (the bank on which the item is drawn) to hold the item beyond its midnight deadline. If an item you deposit is returned unpaid, you waive the requirement for notice of this return.

If a claim is made on any item subsequent to final payment on the grounds that the item was altered, bears a forged or unauthorized endorsement, or was not otherwise properly payable, we may withhold credit for the item from your account until final determination of the claim. In addition, we will not be liable for a check, draft or other item that you deposit that has been forged or altered in such a way that a reasonable person could not discover the forgery.

20. Funds Availability

Information contained in this section is to assist you in understanding our Funds Availability Policy. YouWorld does not accept in-person or mailed deposits.

20.1 General Funds Availability Policy

It is our policy to review each deposit and determine how the funds are being deposited. We make the funds available to you according to the deposit type and when the funds are applied to your account. Some deposit types may not be available for immediate use. When we delay the availability of funds or place a hold on a deposit made to your account, you may not withdraw those funds, and we will not use them to pay bills or other debits, such as ACH withdrawals or wire transfers, during the hold period.

We reserve the right to refuse any deposit. If final payment is not received on any item you deposited to your account, or if any direct deposit, ACH deposit or Electronic Fund Transfer to your account is returned to us for any reason, you agree to pay us the amount of the return, plus any fee in accordance with our schedule of fees.

20.2 Availability

The length of delay in the availability of funds varies depending on the type of deposit. Special rules may apply to new accounts.

20.3 Business Days

The length of delay in the availability of funds is counted in business days from the day your deposit is applied to your account. Deposits received after 5:00 PM (CST) will be considered to be received on the next business.  

20.4 Same-Day Availability

Funds from wire transfers, transfers between YouWorld accounts, preauthorized electronic payments such as payroll direct deposits, or other preauthorized electronic payments will be available on the day the deposit is applied to your account.

Funds from Customer-initiated electronic payments or transfers will be applied to the account when YouWorld has verified the external account and received payment in collected funds. Once the funds are applied to your account, they will have same-day availability.

20.5 Check deposits

If YouWorld offers check deposits your deposit will be available no sooner than the fourth business day after we receive the check. 

Funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer time period based on our review of the check and your account history.  They will generally be available no later than the seventh business day after the day of your deposit.

If you need to be sure when a particular deposit will be available for withdrawal, you can verify the availability of your deposit by viewing the transaction detail on your YouWorld mobile app or contact us.

20.6 Special Rules for New Accounts

Special rules apply during the first 30 days of any new account you open with YouWorld:

Funds from wire transfers or ACH direct deposits will be available on the second business day after the deposit is applied to your account.
All check deposits may be held for an extended period of time but no longer than five business days after deposit is received.

21. Electronic Fund Transfer (“EFTs”) Disclosures

We offer account services that may be considered “Electronic Fund Transfers,” including, but not limited to, ATM transactions; ACH transactions, including, but not limited to, direct deposits and pre-authorized withdrawals; and online transfers. This disclosure (as required by Federal Regulation E: Electronic Fund Transfer Act) provides information that describes your rights and responsibilities regarding these services. The Electronic Fund Transfer services are services that we can provide, assuming that you specifically request and arrange them and qualify for the service. 

21.1 Card Activation

You must activate your Card in accordance with the instructions provided with your Card before it can be used. You will need to provide your personal and card information in order to verify your identity and activate your card. You must sign the signature strip on the back of the card as soon as it’s received.

21.2 ATM and Debit Card Transactions

Consistent with applicable law, you may use your debit card with your PIN to perform most routine transactions on the accounts that are accessible by your debit card, such as to:

Make cash withdrawals
Obtain your most recently available account balance
Pay for purchases at places that have agreed to accept the card

Some of the above services may not be available at all ATMs or locations.

21.3 Authorized Card Users

You are responsible for all authorized transactions initiated and fees incurred by use of your card. If you permit another person to have access to your card or card number, we will treat this as if you have authorized such use and you will be liable for all transactions and fees incurred by those persons. You are wholly responsible for the use of each card according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

21.4 International ATM Transactions

International transactions made using your debit card will be converted to U.S. currency according to the rules and regulations of the card network. The conversion of the currency to U.S. currency may occur on a date other than your original transaction date and fees may be assessed by these networks. You are responsible for the U.S. currency amount plus any fees assessed for the currency conversion. Some services may not be available at international ATM terminals. International ATM transactions may be subject to a fee in accordance with our Schedule of Fees.

21.5 ATM Deposits

Your YouWorld debit card does not permit deposits at ATMs.

21.6 Debit Card Point-of-Sale Transactions

You may use your debit card to purchase goods and services and/or obtain cash where permitted by the merchant, from any merchant who accepts Visa. The merchant may require your signature instead of your PIN to authorize the purchase request. You may also use your debit card with your PIN at any merchant location where ATM cards are accepted to purchase goods, services, and/or obtain cash where permitted by the merchant. The amount of all purchases, including any cash obtained, will be deducted from your checking account. When you make a purchase through the Card network, we may place a hold on the funds in your checking account in the amount that may be necessary to cover the amount of the transaction. (Please see Preauthorization Holds for additional information.)

21.7 Split Transactions

If you do not have sufficient funds in your account, you can instruct the merchant to charge a part of the purchase to the card and pay the remaining amount with cash or another card. These are called “split transactions.” Some merchants do not allow cardholders to conduct split transactions. Some merchants will only allow you to do a split transaction if you pay the remaining amount in cash. If you fail to inform the merchant that you would like to complete a split transaction prior to swiping your card, the card transaction is likely to be declined.

21.8 Transactions Using Your Card Number

If you initiate a transaction without presenting your Card (such as for mail order, internet or telephone purchase, a Prefunded Check purchase or an ACH debit purchase), the legal effect will be the same as if you used the Card itself.

21.9 Limitations on Frequency of Debit Card Transactions and Cash Withdrawal Limits

Frequency-of-use limitations are imposed on card transactions for security reasons and for the protection of your account. They are not disclosed for this reason and may be changed at any time. You will be denied the use of your card if:

You exceed the daily ATM withdrawal or purchase limit (Please refer to your numbership guide);
You do not have sufficient available funds in your account;
You do not enter your correct PIN; or
You exceed the limit on the number of times you can use your card each day.

The receipt provided by the ATM or merchant terminal will notify you of the denial. There is a limit on the number of such denials permitted, beyond which the machine may retain your card. The number of attempts that will cause the retention of your card is also not disclosed for security reasons.

You may not withdraw more than $500 cash at an ATM and during a POS purchase, or purchase more than $75,000.00 worth of goods or services on any calendar day. 

21.10 Preauthorization Holds

When your debit card or other network enhancement feature related to the card is used at a point-of-sale location to obtain goods or services or obtain cash, the merchant may attempt to obtain preauthorization from us for the transaction. We may place a hold on your account for the amount of the preauthorization request for a duration based on the vendor type.  This can range from 2 days to 30 days and may vary in some cases from the amount of the actual purchase, depending on the merchant’s request. If the preauthorization request varies from the amount of the actual transaction, payment of the transaction may not remove the hold, which will remain on the account until the end of the hold period. This hold may affect the availability of funds from your checking account to pay checks or for other Electronic Fund Transfers. We will not be responsible for damages for wrongful dishonor of any items that are not paid because of the hold. 

21.11 Preauthorized (ACH) Debits or Credits

You may arrange to have certain recurring payments automatically deposited (credited) to your account. Examples of this service include the direct deposit of Social Security and other government payments, and the direct deposit of your payroll. 
You may arrange to have certain recurring withdrawals automatically paid (debited) from your account. For example, you may arrange to have insurance premiums paid automatically. 

These preauthorized transfers are governed by federal regulations pertaining to Electronic Fund Transfer services that entitle you to certain protections. Requests for these services must be authorized by you, in writing, to the Originator of the transaction prior to becoming effective. 

21.12 Right to Stop Preauthorized Electronic Transfers (ACH)

If you want to permanently revoke an ACH you authorized from a third party, you will need to first send written instructions to the originating third party to cancel your ACH transfer. 

If you have authorized regular payments out of your account, you can stop any of these payments by notifying Customer Service by telephone or email. If you notify us by telephone, you may be required to confirm the information provided by writing to us at customer.service@tillstar.com.

Your request must include your account number, the name of the payee, the amount of the item to be stopped, and the date payment was scheduled to be made. This request needs to be received by us three (3) or more business days before the payment is scheduled to be made. If your request is by telephone or email, we may also require you to put your request in writing and ensure that it is received by us within 14 days after your call or email.

You are subject to the general rules of Stop-Payment Orders in this Agreement. 

21.13 Stop Payment Liability

If you request that we stop payment on any preauthorized transfer according to the requirements above and we fail to do so, we will be liable for your proven loss or damages, unless:

You failed to give us enough information, proper instructions or sufficient time to act on the stop payment; or
We do not receive written confirmation of your telephone or email request to stop payment within 14 calendar days, and the preauthorized transfer occurs after the 14 calendar days. 

In any case, we will only be liable for actual proven damages if the failure to stop payment on your transaction resulted from a bonafide error on our part, despite our procedures to avoid such errors. If we pay a preauthorized transfer despite your valid and timely stop order request, we may re-credit your account. If we do this, you will sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee. You agree to transfer to us all of your rights against the payee. In addition, you will assist us in any legal action taken against the payee. 

Additionally, if you want to permanently revoke a recurring preauthorized electronic transfer, you will need to first send written instructions to the originating third party to cancel your preauthorized transfer. We may ask you to provide us with a copy of your letter to the originating third party and sign an Affidavit revoking authorization. 

21.14 Our Liability for Failure to Complete an Electronic Fund Transfer

If we fail to complete an Electronic Fund Transfer transaction on time or in the correct amount when properly instructed by you, we will be liable for damages caused by our failure unless:

There aren’t sufficient funds in your account to complete the transaction through no fault of ours;
The funds in your account aren’t available at the time the EFT posts to your account;
The funds in your account are subject to legal process;
The ATM system has insufficient cash to complete the transaction;
Your card has been reported lost or stolen and you are using the reported card;
We have a reason to believe that the transaction requested is unauthorized;
The failure is due to an equipment breakdown that you knew about when you started the transaction at an ATM or merchant terminal;
You attempt to complete a transaction at an ATM or merchant terminal that is not a permissible transaction listed above; or
The transaction would exceed security limitations on the use of your debit card.

In any case, we will only be liable for actual proven damages if the failure to make the transaction resulted from an honest error despite our procedures to avoid such errors.

21.15 Unauthorized Transfers

Tell us immediately if you believe your debit card and/or PIN has been lost or stolen, or if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission.  Contacting us by phone or email is the best way to keep your potential losses down. You could lose all the money in your account!

If you tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your debit card and/or PIN, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your debit card and/or PIN without your permission. 

If you do NOT tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your debit card and/or PIN, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your debit card and/or PIN without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.

Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by card, code or other means, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after your account statement is made available to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days, if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time. If extenuating circumstances kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods at our sole discretion.

You may be required to confirm the information provided over phone or email in writing. In these cases, we will advise you, accordingly, provide you the necessary forms for confirming your dispute in writing, and give you instructions for sending us the signed form.

21.16 Errors or Questions and How to Contact Us

In case of errors or questions about your Electronic Fund Transfers, you agree to promptly contact Customer Service by email at hello@bewildcard.com.  You may be required to confirm the information in writing within 10 business days. In these cases, we will advise you accordingly, provide you the necessary forms for confirming your dispute in writing, and give you instructions for sending us the signed form.

If you believe an Electronic Fund Transfer transaction was processed in error or was unauthorized, or if you need more information about a transfer listed on your statement or receipt, you must contact YouWorld no later than 60 days after the problem or error first appeared on your statement.

In your communication with us, please provide the following information:

The account name, account number, and last four digits of the debit card number, if applicable;
A description of the suspected error or the transfer about which you are unsure, why you believe there is an error, or why you need more information;
The dollar amount of the suspected error; and
The date of the suspected error.

When we receive your dispute notification, we will advise you of the status of our investigation within 10 business days. In all cases, we will correct any error promptly.

If we need more time to investigate your question or complaint, we may take up to 45 calendar days for ATM transactions (other than international transactions) and ACH transactions. For errors involving new accounts within 30 calendar daysafter the first deposit, point-of-sale transactions or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 calendar days to investigate your complaint or question. If this is necessary, we will provisionally credit your account, when applicable, for the amount you believe is in error within 10 business days of your original complaint or question, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we do not receive your written confirmation of your questions or complaint within 10 business days, we may decide not to provisionally credit your account.

For errors involving new accounts, point-of-sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. For new accounts, we may take up to 20 business days to credit your account for the amount you think is in error.

We will send you a written explanation within three (3) business days after we finish our investigation. You may ask for copies of the documents we used in our investigation. If provisional credit was given and it is determined that there was no error, you must repay to us the amount of the provisional credit for the disputed item(s). You will have access to those funds for five (5) business days, and then we may deduct such amounts from your account without further notice.

21.17 Debit Card Revocation

You agree that your debit card remains the property of First Pryority Bank and shall be surrendered upon demand. The card is non-transferable, and it may be canceled, reposed, or revoked at any time without prior notice subject to applicable law.

If you do not use your debit card for an extended period, defined by YouWorld as 90 days, or we believe the card may be lost/stolen or is being used improperly, it may be canceled for security reasons and will be unusable. This may occur without prior notice to you. 

If your card is reissued or reactivated, we may charge you a fee for its reissue/replacement in accordance with our schedule of fees.

21.18 Fees and Charges

You will pay any applicable fees and charges we assess for your Card services and/or other electronic services that you select. Applicable fees will be deducted from your account and listed on your account statement. These charges and fees are assessed in accordance with our schedule of fees.

You may be charged a foreign transaction fee for point-of-sale purchases made internationally. The terminal owner may also charge you a fee for use of their ATM. You may, however, be assessed a fee by the card association, for example, Visa, for using your Card at an ATM or making a point-of-sale purchase.

22. PIN, Passwords, and Passcodes

22.1 Card PIN

You will be prompted to assign a 4-digit card PIN for your YouWorld debit card during card activation. You may change the PIN at any time by accessing the card PIN change process through the mobile app or our automated telephone service.

22.3 Funds Transfer Service

“Funds Transfer” is an electronic transfer service provided by YouWorld and powered by First Pryority Bank that enables you to securely transfer funds from an account at another financial institution to your account with us, and/or from your account with us to an account at another financial institution. Prior to use, you are required to register your external bank account for verification and security purposes. Once your Funds Transfer service is active, please refer to the Funds Availability schedule to see when your Funds will be available for your use in your account. In all cases, funds may be held until we receive verification that the transaction has settled.

By using the Funds Transfer service, you agree that the Bank will transfer funds through ACH services and that the transaction is subject to completion upon our final review and verification. You agree that such requests constitute authorization for such transfers. This authorization is to remain in full force until the Bank has received written notification from you of its termination, you have electronically deleted a registered bank account or credit card from the Funds Transfer service, or you have electronically canceled an account and/or transfers from the Funds Transfer service in such time and in such manner as to afford the Bank and the other financial institution a reasonable opportunity to act on it.

This service may be subject to a fee in accordance with our schedule of fees. This service may not be available for all customers and/or account types. Please review our Funds Transfer FAQs for information on availability.

By using the Funds Transfer service, you are certifying that the registered external accounts that you transfer funds to and from, and the debit or credit cards used to transfer from are under the same ownership as the account with us. In the event that the accounts are not titled the same or ownership among the transferring accounts changes, you will indemnify us for any losses incurred as a result of any transaction you initiate between these accounts that is later returned or is reported unauthorized. If initiate a transfer that is found to be unverifiable or is unable to be completed for other reasons, you agree to hold us harmless for any loss resulting from the incomplete transfer.  If a transfer is made from a third-party’s account or registered as an external deposit account, before we detect it, we may without notice to you, place those funds on hold and debit your account, and return the funds to the third party's account in the form of a bank check or funds transfer, once we have confirmed the funds cleared the external account.

If you use the Funds Transfer service to transfer funds to or from an account that has multiple owners, you agree that each owner authorizes the others to (a) initiate the transfer of funds between your accounts with us, as permitted by the Funds Transfer service, (b) register any external bank account or credit card, as permitted by the Funds Transfer service, and (c) initiate the transfer of funds between your account(s) with us and any registered external bank account or credit card. This authority will cease only after we have received and have been given a reasonable amount of time to act on the appropriate documentation needed to change or remove the owner from the account. Each account owner agrees to be jointly and severally liable to YouWorld for any losses incurred as a result of the improper use of this service up to and including the transfer amount, any applicable fees and any legal expenses. Your Funds Transfer request will only be completed if you have sufficient funds in the account from which you wish to transfer funds and the accounts are linked for transfer capabilities. Funds Transfer transactions are subject to dollar amount limitations, which are determined by us and may be set according to your Account type and/or the type of Funds Transfer service you are using. These limitations are set for security reasons and are not disclosed for that reason.

YouWorld reserves the right to limit the number of external accounts that can be linked to your account for purposes of transferring funds; to limit functionality of the Funds Transfer service by imposing limits, holds, or other measures; and to close your account if unlawful activity is found or suspected.
